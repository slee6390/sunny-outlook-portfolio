              <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This project centered on creating an interactive card game that bridges generational divides 
                through structured dialogue and shared storytelling. The game was designed to facilitate 
                meaningful conversations between people of different age groups, fostering mutual understanding 
                and knowledge transfer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
                By combining principles of game-based learning with user-centered design, the project aimed 
                to address social isolation and communication barriers that often exist across generations.

                As the product strategist and researcher, I shaped the game's vision and led the development 
                process from concept to execution. This involved conducting extensive user research, designing 
                game mechanics that foster authentic connection, and coordinating with cross-functional teams 
                to bring the product to life.
